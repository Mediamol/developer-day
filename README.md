# Git Merge Developer Day

The first day of Git Merge will be limited to developers who have made significant contributions to Git core or an alternate Git implementation (jgit, libgit2, etc.).

As with the previous GitTogethers, this day will be unconference style where we will determine what everyone is going to talk about or work on during the course of the day.

If you know you want to talk about something and are attending this day, please **create an issue** on this repository so we can get all the topics together.

## Documentation

I will be trying to document the proceedings of the day, but if you want to help or if I miss something, please add it yourself by forking this repository and sending me a pull request.  All of the docs will go in the `docs` directory.
